This files list the people, outside of the original development team that help in the project.
Their contributions were very helpful, so I guess they should have their names listed somewhere.

Thanks to:
   Contributors that are not colleagues or students
	- Tom "spot" Callaway <tcallawa@redhat.com>, for his experience and wiseness in RPM packaging. 
	- People from maling-list nfsv4@linux-nfs.org (with special attention to J. Bruce Fields 
	  and Trond Myklebust) for their help understanding the complex logic within NFSv4

   Students that came to make an intership with us and worked on the project
	- Mickael Guerin who wrote the first release of the FSAL_POSIX
	- Laureline Provost who wrote a PERL library that had been very useful to quickly write benchmarks 
          and non-regression test
	- Cedric Cabessa who worked on the SNMP admin module
	- Adrien Grellier who provided us with the first TI-RPC support in the product
