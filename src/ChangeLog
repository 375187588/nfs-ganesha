0.99.39 - Mon 21 Jul 2008
	- Initial version submitted to sourceforge

0.99.40 - Mon 28 Jul 2008 
	- Fixed several memory issues in NFSv4 implementation 
	- Fixed several memory issues in FSAL_PROXY
	- Fixed a badly placed Mem_Free in support/nfs_state_id.c (function nfs4_State_Del)
        - Added Handle Mapping feature in FSAL_PROXY which makes it possible to export
          back in NFSv2 and NFSv3 from a proxyfied server accessed via NFSv4

0.99.41 - Mon 18 Aug 2008
	- Fixed nfs4_op_access bug due to bad interpretation of the RFC for
	  OP_ACCESS4
	- Added extended features in BuddyMalloc module to enable extended
	  memory leak tracking (run the ./configure script with the following
	  options : "--enable-debug-memleaks --disable-block-prealloc")
	- Fixed a bug in FSAL_PROXY that made every user have root permissions
	  in a few situations
	- Bug fixed: bad offset management in FSAL_read/FSAL_write for
	  FSAL_PROXY. This made the datacache behaves weirdly. 
	- Use All-0 stateid for r/w operations made for maintaining the data
	  cache coherent with the "proxyfied" server with FSAL_PROXY. Due to
	  this the parameter NFSv4_Proxy::Open_by_FH_Working_Dir is no more
	  required, making the configuration of nfs-ganesha as a proxy much
	  easier
	- FSAL_PROXY now supports RPCSEC_GSS authentication

0.99.42 - Mon 29 Sep 2008
	- Added xattr support in NFSv4. For object "foo" a ghost
	  directory name ".xattr.d.foo" is used to access extended attributes
        - Added xattr ghost directory and ghost objects for NFSv3. These "extended
	  attributes" are read-only for the moment. These two new features may
          be disable if "--disable-xattr-directory" is used at "./configure" time
        - Enhancement in FSAL_GetXattrs function (file FSAL/FSAL_*/fsal_xattrs.c) for
          making integration to xattr.d easier

0.99.43 - Fri 10 Oct 2008
        - Fixed RPCSEC_GSS support. It is now possible to mount with krb5
	  authentication. Security tuple krb5, krb5i and krb5p are supported
	- Add RPCSEC_GSS specifc feature for NFSv4
	- Add RPCSEC_GSS specifc feature for NFSv3
	- Configuration file supports "nodesets" syntax( the set
     	  "node1,node3,node4,node5,node6" can be summarized as
	  "node[1,3,4-6]). This feature is very useful if your client is a
	  cluster.
	- New RPM packaging. 
	- The libganeshaNFS that provide NFS exports for FUSE ready product is
	  now available as both static and shared libraries. 

0.99.44 - Mon 20 Oct 2008 
        - NFS4_OP_OPEN default behaviour is now to ask the client to confirm 
	  the open using NFS5_OP_OPEN_CONFIRM. The default behaviour was
	  formerly the opposite.
	- A bug in NFS4_OP_OPEN : same open_owner could have multiple states
	  on the same file in certain cases 
	- Many bug fixed in NFS4_OP_LOCK
	- libganeshaNFS (produced when FSAL_FUSELIKE is chosen) can now be
	  managed by pkgconfig (a ".pc" file is added to the install target)
	- Improved compatibility for old FUSE filesystems that implement getdir
	  instead of readdir.
	- FUSE-like binding now support filesystems with no inode numbers.
	- TIRPC can be use as alternate RPC layer. In later releases, this
	  feature will be used to support IPv6 with NFS-GANESHA.
	- Added a 'init' scripts to be place in /etc/init.d 
	- Added stuff to specfile so that it installs the .vim files

0.99.45 - Wed  5 Nov 2008 
	- Add IPv6 support via TIRPC support 
	- Add features to configuration file parsing for IPv6 address
	- Bug fix in handle mapping module for FSAL_PROXY
	- Bug Fix: Bad verifier management in FSAL_PROXY's cleintid
	  negociation
	- Bug fix: bad management of uid=0 is uidgidmap cache when using
	  RPCSEC_GSS authentication.
	- Bug fix: several bug fixed in .xattr.d management for NFSv3

0.99.46 - Wed 18 Nov 2008 	
	- Bug fix: possible deadlock may occur in worker thread when using tcp
	  clients
	- Minor feature: MD cache now uses home made RW_Lock (the same that 
	  Hashtable module already uses). Call rw_lock_downgrade was added to
	  RW_Lock module
	- DataCache GC is done by an external call to the ganesha service
	  started in "syncers" of "flushers" mode.

0.99.47 - Thu  4 Dec 2008
	- Running the Spec benchmark on nfs-ganesha showed a bug in attributes
	  asked at creation time in NFSPROC3_CREATE, this has been fixed
	- Fix non-compliancy (thanks again to Spec NFS) in NFSPROC3_SYMLINK (attributes provided as 
	  arguments were never used).
	- Code cleanup: removed structure related to deprecated way of
	  performing datacache's garbagge collection.
	- Major feature added : skeleton and "basements" added for MFSL, a
	  new module that goes between md cache and FSAL 
	- Removed direct Cache_Inode_Async, md writeback will be provided in a
	  future module MFSL_ASYNC in MFSL directory 
	 
0.99.48	- Mon 15 Dec 2008
	- Renamed yyparse and yylex functions so that GANESHA/FUSE would no
	  more interfer with FUSE modules that uses lex/yacc parsing
	- FSAL_PROXY was ported to MacOS X (Darwin 9.5.0)
	- FSAL_FUSE was ported to MacOS X (Darwin 9.5.0). This allow user
	  space libs with fuse binding to be used from MacOS through
	  NFS-GANESHA
	- FSAL_SNMP has been ported to MacOS X (Darwin 9.5.0)
	- FSAL_POSIX has been ported to MacOS X (Darwin 9.5.0)

        - FSAL_PROXY has been ported to FreeBSD 7.0
        - FSAL_FUSE has been ported to FreeBSD 7.0 (FUSE ready product can now
	  export in NFS via NFS-GANESHA)
        - FSAL_POSIX has been ported to FreeBSD 7.0
        - FSAL_SNMP has been ported to FreeBSD 7.0
	- Code has been ported and validated to ia64 architecture for all
	  FSALs

0.99.50 - Fri 23 Jan 2009
	- Code has been validated on PPC/Linux architecture 
	- Fixed a Makefile.am that prevent from compiling with FSAL_FUSE and

0.99.51 - Fri 20 Mar 2009
        - MySQL can be used instead of PGSQL in FSAL_POSIX. It becomes the
  	  default database for this FSAL.
	- Bug Fix: Massive and parralel mount requests (e.g. : all nodes of a
	  compute cluster starting at the same time after a maintenance) could
	  lead to errors on client. This "denial of service" like trouble has
	  been fixed.
	- Bug Fix: bad computation in FH checksum when compiled on x86_64 architecture 
	- MFSL_ASYNC: setattr has been made asynchronous
	- MFSL_ASYNC: link has been made asynchronous

	  This is to be activated by using --with-mfsl=ASYNC at configure time. 

0.99.52	-
        - Bug Fix: possible race condition in cache_inode_readdir (badly placed rw_lock_downgrade) that could
          lead in having cache_inode_readdir_populate called twice at the same time.
        - MFSL_ASYNC: now, preallocated entries are owned by each
