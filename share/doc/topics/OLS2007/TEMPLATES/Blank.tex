% The file must begin with this \documentclass declaration. You can 
% give one of three different options which control how picky LaTeX 
% is when typesetting:
%
% galley - All ``this doesn't fit'' warnings are suppressed, and 
%          references are disabled (the key will be printed as a
%          reminder).  Use this mode while writing.
%
% proof -  All ``this doesn't fit'' warnings are active, as are
%          references.  Overfull hboxes make ugly black blobs in
%          the margin.  Use this mode to tidy up formatting after
%          you're done writing.  (Same as article's ``draft'' mode.)
%
% final -  As proof, but the ugly black blobs are turned off.  Use
%          this to render PDFs or PostScript to give to other people,
%          when you're completely done.  (As with article, this is the
%          default.)
%
% You can also use the leqno, fleqn, or openbib options to article.cls
% if you wish.  None of article's other options will work.

\documentclass[final]{ols}

% These two packages allow easy handling of urls and identifiers per the example paper.
\usepackage{url}
\usepackage{zrl}

% The following package is not required, but is a handy way to put PDF and EPS graphics
% into your paper using the \includegraphics command.
\ifpdf
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
\else
\usepackage{graphicx}
\fi


% Here in the preamble, you may load additional packages, or
% define whatever macros you like, with the following exceptions:
%
% - Do not mess with the page layout, either by hand or with packages
%   (e.g., typearea, geometry).
% - Do not change the principal fonts, either by hand or with packages.
% - Do not use \pagestyle, or load any page header-related packages.
% - Do not redefine any commands having to do with article titles.
% - If you are using something that is not part of the standard
%   tetex-2 distribution, please make a note of whether it's on CTAN,
%   or include a copy with your submission.

\begin{document}

% Mandatory: article title specification.
% Do not put line breaks or other clever formatting in \title or
% \shortauthor; these are moving arguments.

\title{__TITLE__}
\subtitle{__SUBTITLE__}  % Subtitle is optional.
\date{}             % You can put a fixed date in if you wish,
                    % allow LaTeX to use the date of typesetting,
                    % or use \date{} to have no date at all.
                    % Whatever you do, there will not be a date
                    % shown in the proceedings.

\shortauthor{__AUTHOR__}  % Just you and your coauthors' names.
% for example, \shortauthor{A.N.\ Author and A.\ Nother}
% or perchance \shortauthor{Smith, Jones, Black, White, Gray, \& Greene}

\author{%  Authors, affiliations, and email addresses go here, like this:
__AUTHOR__ \\
