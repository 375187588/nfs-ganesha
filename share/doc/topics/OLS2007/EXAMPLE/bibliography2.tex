Here's another way of handling bibliographies; it does
not use a .bib file, but includes the items at the end
of the paper, before \end{document}.

Each item has the format
\bibitem[printName]{citeName} details

The "printName" will be printed at the point of your citation,
and again in the list of references.  The "citeName" is what
you use in the source to create the citation.  For example,
using the first entry below, I could \cite{menyhart} and
have the author's name print out properly in the appropriate
places.

The bibliography below comes from Tony Luck's 2003 Linux
Symposium paper:
