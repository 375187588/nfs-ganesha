Sometimes you have to do things differently depending on whether
you're building the entire Proceedings... here's an example...

\ifols
\usepackage{cprog}
\usepackage[nolineno,norules]{lgrind}
\usepackage[hang,scriptsize]{subfigure}
\else
\usepackage{subfigure}
%%% both of these break the Proceedings and are thus evil
\usepackage{listings}
\input{llvm.lst}    % Get listing support for llvm code
\fi
