<p><br>
<br>
<p>This document is an abstract of a presentation to be made during the
LSM&nbsp;conference (July 9-12 in Metz).
<p>The need for secured client/server application has grown and is continuously
growing in today's computer science. Security mechanisms are well defined
but each of them has its own application programming interface. This binds
the secured application to an API&nbsp;and a security mechanism, a situation
that causes a real lack of portability.
<br>The Generic Security Service Application Programing Interface (GSSAPI)
is a standardized API&nbsp;designed to be used on top of every security
mechanism, making it possible to write application with strong portability
features between different security paradigms. It is designed to be used
instead of mechanism's specific APIs and provide the same services.
<br>This presentation shows, from a secured client/server developer's point
of view, the different features the GSSAPI&nbsp;and the way they can be
used, including the RPCSEC_GSS&nbsp;which is an extension of ONC&nbsp;RPC
which includes GSSAPI&nbsp;support.
